          Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's size length grow or shrink at any time, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.  </p>

        <p>Some people think that you shouldn't use an array as an associative array. In any case, you can use plain objects instead, although doing so comes with its own caveats.</p>
