        <p>Block-level elements. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements are usually either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block."</p>
        my-first-webpage.html
<p>This is my first web page!</p>
<p>Isn't it nice?</p>
The <p> is called a p tag, and it means that everything that follows is a paragraph, until </p> is reached. The </p> is called a closing tag or end tag.

Now, if we open the file in a web browser (by double-clicking it), we have two paragraphs of text. We just wrote our first HTML code!

Now, let's add some more stuff to the page:

my-first-webpage.html
h1 My first web page h1
<h2>Written with the guidance of Epicodus</h2>

<p>This is my first web page!</p>
<p>Isn't it nice?</p>
Here, we've added a main header (<h1>) and a subheader (<h2>). You can actually add up to six different levels of headers using <h1> through <h6>.

HTML ignores spaces and blank lines, which together are called whitespace. That's why the extra line between our headers and paragraphs doesn't do anything. We could take it out, or make it three spaces, and it would look exactly the same in the browser.

Let's add some elements to our page:
      </div>
